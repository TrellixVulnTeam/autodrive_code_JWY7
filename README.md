#Segmentation of Roads from Satellite images
Semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel belonging to a particular label. Specifically, in this project, we will identify which region of the satellite image belongs to the road using Deep Learning. Our model is trained based on DeepLab V3+ model and its pre-trained model on Cityscapes Semantic Segmentation Dataset. Minimal adjustment was done on the initial architecture.
